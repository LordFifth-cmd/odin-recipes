    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken and dumplings is a classic, soul-warming dish that evokes feelings of home, nostalgia, and the kind of culinary comfort only a grandmother's kitchen could offer. It brings together tender chunks of chicken and soft, pillowy dumplings in a rich and savory broth. The chicken, slow-cooked to perfection, provides a hearty base, while the dumplings, either dropped or rolled, introduce a delightful contrasting texture—soft, yet with a slight chewiness. Often laced with aromatic vegetables like celery, carrots, and onions, the dish becomes a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. Chicken and dumplings, in its simplicity, embodies the essence of homestyle cooking—a heartwarming meal that not only fills the belly but also soothes the soul. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2-3 pounds of chicken pieces (breasts, thighs, or a combination)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2-3 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, sliced</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth or stock</li>
        <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (for thickening, if desired)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream or milk (optional, for a creamier consistency)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or dill (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter or shortening, cold and cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>3/4 to 1 cup milk or buttermilk</li>
        <li>Optional herbs (like chopped parsley or dill) for added flavor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Preparation:</strong>
            Clean and cut the chicken pieces as needed. Dice the onion, slice the carrots and celery, and mince the
            garlic.</li>
        <li> <strong>Cook the Vegetables:</strong>
            In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil or butter over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots,
            and celery, and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for another 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Brown the Chicken:</strong>
            Add the chicken pieces to the pot, seasoning them with salt and pepper. Cook until they're lightly browned
            on all sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Broth:</strong> Pour in the chicken broth or stock and toss in the bay leaves. Bring the
            mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let the chicken cook until it's tender and fully
            cooked, which should take about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Dumpling Dough:</strong> While the chicken is simmering, in a mixing bowl, combine the
            all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the cold butter pieces until the mixture resembles coarse
            crumbs. Gradually add in the milk, mixing until a soft dough forms. If you're adding herbs for flavor, mix
            them into the dough now.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Dumplings:</strong> Once the chicken is cooked, drop spoonfuls of the dumpling dough into
            the simmering stew. Ensure they're spaced apart as they'll expand while cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Dumplings:</strong> Cover the pot with a lid and let the dumplings cook for about 15-20
            minutes. They should become firm and rise to the surface once they're done.</li>
        <li><strong>Thicken the Stew (Optional):</strong> If you prefer a thicker stew, mix the all-purpose flour with a
            bit of cold water to create a slurry, then stir it into the pot. Alternatively, you can remove some of the
            hot broth, mix it with the flour, and then stir the mixture back into the pot to thicken the stew.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Creaminess (Optional):</strong> For a creamier texture, stir in the heavy cream or milk at this
            stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Seasoning and Serving:</strong> Remove the bay leaves. Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning
            with more salt and pepper if needed. Garnish with fresh parsley or dill if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!
